  "articleBody": " By Ben West\nI spent part of my morning listening to the swearing-in ceremony for Canada’s newest ministers, and what I heard stuck with me. Not the cabinet picks (though we could talk about that, too), but the words they were made to say: a solemn pledge of allegiance to “His Majesty King Charles the Third, his heirs and successors.”\nIn 2025. In a modern democracy. In a country where we pride ourselves on being independent, progressive, and self-governing, we are still asking ministers—our most powerful elected officials—to pledge fealty not to the people, not even to the Constitution, but to a literal king.\nAnd not just a king. This king. The guy who couldn’t even get his own pens to work during his coronation tour. The guy who wears jewels stolen from colonized nations and sits atop an institution built on centuries of slavery, imperialism, and violent dispossession.\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t just ceremonial fluff. Canada may pretend to be a modern democracy with a decorative crown, but the reality is more twisted: we are a monarchy pretending not to be one. And the consequences of that show up in subtle—and not-so-subtle—ways.\nTake the upcoming Speech from the Throne. It’s now confirmed that King Charles III himself will deliver it — something that has only happened twice before in Canadian history. Queen Elizabeth II read the Speech from the Throne in 1957 and again in 1977, both during symbolic royal tours. That means this will be the first time in 48 years that a reigning monarch has done so — and only the third time ever.\nA symbolic move, sure — but symbols matter. And in the context of a rising authoritarian wave south of the border, the timing feels, well… ironic.\nBecause while the Republican Party south of the border appears to have rallied behind a man who believes he is a king, here we are in Canada trying to claim we’re not one—while having our ministers swear loyalty to a royal family. It’s like cosplay constitutionalism. And I say this with respect to cosplay.\nBut the irony goes even deeper. Today, people who oppose monarchy are often called republicans—as if rejecting hereditary power aligns them with the same authoritarian brand that now controls the U.S. Republican Party. We need a better word. Because the answer to one totalitarian regime is not to run back to the mothership of imperial institutions and a deeply corrupt family.\nNow, you might be saying, “Ben, c’mon. The monarchy doesn’t really have power in Canada.” But here’s the thing: it does. Not in the day-to-day grind of governance, no. But in moments of crisis, the Crown’s representatives—our Governor General and the Lieutenant Governors—hold real reserve powers. They’ve exercised them before. And they could again.\nRemember 2017? Christy Clark, then Premier of British Columbia, lost the confidence of the Legislature. Rather than dissolving Parliament as she requested, Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon invited John Horgan to form government. That’s not just a ribbon-cutting role—that’s power. And in that case, it arguably worked in the public’s favour. But that doesn’t mean we should be comfortable with unelected officials having the final say on who governs us.\nOr take Stephen Harper’s 2008 prorogation crisis. Facing a confidence vote he was likely to lose, he asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament. Michaëlle Jean agreed. Many framed this as a wise avoidance of crisis—but in truth, a majority of Members of Parliament had signed a letter indicating their desire to form an alternative government. The Governor General made a choice: she backed a sitting Prime Minister rather than respecting the stated will of a majority of elected representatives. That’s not democratic restraint. That’s institutional bias disguised as neutrality.\nAnd don’t forget: Mark Carney—now Prime Minister and former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England—has defended this arrangement as a bulwark of Canadian sovereignty. But is it? Isn’t it more honest to say that we’re trading self-determination for stability-by-ceremony? That we’re clinging to symbols of empire to avoid having difficult conversations about real democratic renewal?\nThis is especially obvious when you look at the Privy Council, the shadowy constitutional club you join when you become a Cabinet Minister. The Privy Council oath isn’t just a handshake and a nod. It includes pledging lifelong secrecy to the monarch—not to the people of Canada, and certainly not to the public interest. There’s no explicit protection for whistleblowers or exceptions for matters of conscience. Just an expectation of silence, loyalty, and discretion.\nAnd while it’s unlikely that any minister has been prosecuted for breaking that oath, the legal framework is chilling: the Crown remains the legal embodiment of the state. That’s why every criminal case is “R v. You” (R for Rex, the King). You’re not up against the state—you’re up against the Crown. It’s a feudal relic rebranded as liberal democracy.\nAnd the spectacle of monarchy is everywhere, even if we’ve trained ourselves not to see it. The ceremonial mace—or sceptre—that sits in Parliament is not just a fancy baton. It is a literal symbol of the monarch’s authority, without which the House of Commons cannot legally sit. Before each session, it is marched in to signal the King’s blessing. Yes, even now.\nHere’s the kicker: changing this is hard. Like, “every province must agree” hard. Like, “Constitutional quagmire” hard. Abolishing the monarchy in Canada would require a level of federal-provincial consensus we’ve barely achieved in peacetime. It’s easier to rewrite a federal budget than to update our royal allegiances.\nBut here’s the thing: we don’t need to wait for full abolition to act. There are workarounds.\nWe can begin by amending legislation to remove unnecessary royal language in pledges and oaths. We can push for changes that emphasize allegiance to the Constitution, to the Charter, or to the people of Canada—rather than to a hereditary monarch. We can call for reform that ensures reserve powers are more transparently regulated and publicly accountable.\nAnd most importantly, we can talk about it. The Speech from the Throne is a perfect opportunity to raise this question—not just of who reads the speech, but of who the speech is for. Do we want to continue pretending that monarchy is symbolic, or do we want to confront the reality that it still has teeth?\nLet’s have that conversation. Let’s acknowledge the complexity, the history, and yes, the difficulty of change. But let’s not let that stop us from imagining something better.\nBecause in a democracy, we shouldn’t be pretending to be anything. We should be deciding who we are—together.\nBen West is a strategist, writer, and recovering campaigner.\n",
